# Capstone-Project-2
Analyzing sample data by creating visualizations

The purpose of this project was to read a csv file with the panda library. The task entailed that we perform a visual as well as a descriptive analysis
on any missing data the sample data may contain. We had to the fill this data either through classical means of row/column deletion, or through imputation.

The data contained values attributing to different car manufacturers. We were given brand, engine size, milage, car type, price, type of engine, aspiration type, etc.

These values allowed me to create comparitive visuals whereby I employed multiple box plots within testing the price range against aspiration, car-type, car brand.
I used scatter plots to correlate ,milage to engine size.
I created a heatmap to represent how price affects body-style and drivetrain
